# Tapes
_This project is second iteration of [Tapes](https://github.com/phonofidelic/Tapes). Full readme is in progress._

## Introduction

### Overview
Tapes is intended to be an intuitive, low latency interface for creating and cataloging audio recordings using the computerâ€™s default audio input device (mic input or USB capture device). 

Recordings are cached locally on the user's computer, and then stored on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) via [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage/). The database layer is managed using [OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db), which is a distributed peer-to-peer database technology also built on IPFS.

### Motivation
Part of my motivation behind this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the various technologies and frameworks used to build it. It also proved to be a good way to introduce myself to some basic concepts of audio signal processing and dealing with digital audio data. My main motivation however, was to build a tool that I found useful and pleasant to work with. I wanted an application that could quickly record musical ideas or sound samples with minimal setup and also allow for efficient archiving of the generated material.

### Use Cases:
#### _Audio Recording and Cataloging_
As mentioned above, the initial use case for the application is a way to quickly record audio and to have a way to easily archive and search through these recordings. 

#### _Digitization of Analog Music_
Another use case that came up during the course of development was that of digitizing analog recordings from mediums such as vinyl records or tape cassettes.

The application uses [AcoustID](https://acoustid.org/) and [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) to search for and add metadata to the recordings.

## Development

### Binary Dependencies
This project uses the following binaries which must be included in the `bin` directory:

#### [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/)
This project uses the SoX command line utility (v14.4.2) for recording audio. Install the Mac and Windows binaries from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/files/sox/14.4.2/).

#### [Chromaprint - fpcalc](https://acoustid.org/chromaprint)
Tapes uses the [AcoustID](https://acoustid.org/) API for audio identification. In order to do this, an audio fingerprint must be generated using Chromaprint.

#### [Audiodevice](http://whoshacks.blogspot.com/2009/01/change-audio-devices-via-shell-script.html)
A commandline tool used to programmatically set the default audio input device.


### API keys
API keys and tokens need to be obtained for the following services:

#### AcoustID
The AcoustID web service is used for audio identification. You can register your application and obtain an API key [here](https://acoustid.org/webservice).

#### GitHub 
A GitHub token is used when publishing releases. You can read more about this [here](https://www.electronforge.io/config/publishers/github).

#### Web3.Storage
Web3.Storage is used to store audio files on the decentralized web (IPFS). Read more about this [here](https://web3.storage/).

Once keys have been obtained, set them in a `.env` file in the project root:
```
ACOUSTID_API_KEY=<KEY_VALUE>
GITHUB_TOKEN=<TOKEN_VALUE>
WEB3STORAGE_TOKEN=<TOKEN_VALUE>
```
